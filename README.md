### node-typescript-starter

A simple base structure for a Typescript Node project.

Setup:
- configure dependency versions in `package.json`
- install (`npm`/`yarn`) and commit the lock file
- update `tsconfig` and/or `eslint` rules (`no-console` is included as an example)

Running:
- `.vscode/launch.json` configuration allows debugging using `ts-node`.

Scripts:
- `build` - compiles files into the `build` folder
- `clean` - removes `build` folder
- `start` - runs the app from the `build` folder
